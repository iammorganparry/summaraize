      <h2>5. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than [insert
        time period] past the termination of the user's account.
      </p>

      <h2>6. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
        process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
        storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
        promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
        third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly
        collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
        our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our website is at your own risk. You should only
        access the website within a secure environment.
      </p>

      <h2>7. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your
        account at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully
        processing your personal information, you also have the right to
        complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can
        find their contact details here:{" "}

      <h2>8. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, if you are a resident of California, you
        are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal
        information.
      </p>
